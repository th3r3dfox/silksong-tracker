# Silksong Tracker

**Silksong Tracker** is a web-based tool that allows you to analyze and visualize your *Hollow Knight: Silksong* save files.  
It helps players explore their progress, bosses defeated, items collected, and hidden secrets.

All data is processed **locally in your browser** — your save file is never uploaded or stored.

---

## Features

- Upload and decode Silksong `.dat` save files
- View progress for bosses, items, and upgrades
- Toggle **spoiler** and **missing only** filters
- All decoding and rendering happens client-side
- Compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

---

## How to Use

1. Go to the hosted tracker (if deployed) or open `index.html` locally.  
2. Click **Upload Save** or drag your `.dat` file (e.g., `user1.dat`) into the drop area.  
3. The tracker will decode the save and display progress by category.
