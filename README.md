# Silksong Tracker

**[View the Silksong Tracker](https://th3r3dfox.github.io/silksong-tracker/).**

**Silksong Tracker** is a web-based tool that allows you to analyze and visualize your [_Hollow Knight: Silksong_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/) save files. It helps players explore their progress, bosses defeated, items collected, and hidden secrets.

All data is processed **locally in your browser** - your save file is never uploaded or stored.

## Features

- Upload and decode Silksong `.dat` save files
- View progress for bosses, items, and upgrades
- Toggle **spoiler** and **missing only** filters
- All decoding and rendering happens client-side
- Compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

## How to Use

1. Go to the hosted tracker (if deployed) or open `index.html` locally.
2. Click **Upload Save** or drag your `.dat` file (e.g., `user1.dat`) into the drop area.
3. The tracker will decode the save and display progress by category.

## Technical Details

A full explanation of the project architecture, decoding logic, and data model is available here: [docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md](./docs/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md)
