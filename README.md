# Silksong Tracker

**Silksong Tracker** is a web-based tool that allows you to analyze and visualize your *Hollow Knight: Silksong* save files.  
It helps players explore their progress, bosses defeated, items collected, and hidden secrets.

All data is processed **locally in your browser** — your save file is never uploaded or stored.
